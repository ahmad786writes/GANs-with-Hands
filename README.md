# GANs with Hands

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, **GANs with Hands**, which explores the implementation and training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) specifically tailored for generating realistic hand images.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the following key topics:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for preparing datasets containing hand images.
2. **Model Architecture**: Building and understanding the generator and discriminator networks of a GAN.
3. **Training Process**: Implementation of GAN training loops and techniques for stabilizing training.
4. **Visualization**: Visual analysis of generated outputs at various training stages.
5. **Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate the quality of generated hand images.

## Dependencies

The notebook relies on the following libraries and frameworks:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Ensure all dependencies are installed to run the notebook smoothly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GANs-with-Hands.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "GANs with Hands.ipynb"
   ```

## Results
